    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>ummers are made for the grill, but what's a steak lover to do when the weather's too cold and wet to light the suckers up? Just cook them indoors. Indeed, pan-seared steaks have several distinct advantages over grilled steaks—enough that there are times when given the two choices, I'll choose pan-seared just for the sake of it. While grilling will get you a rapid-fire crust on your steak with all those delightfully crisp, on-the-verge-of-burnt bits and a good smoky flavor, I find that the even golden brown crust you can develop in a hot cast-iron pan really accentuates the flavor of the beef itself, letting it shine. On top of that, pan-searing affords 
        you the opportunity to add your own flavorings in the form of aromatics.</p>
    <p>When I've got plenty of time to kill, I occasionally employ a low-and-slow cooking method, such as sous vide, or perhaps the reverse sear method I developed at Cook's Illustrated in which you start the steak in a very low oven and finish it off on the stovetop.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large bone-in T-bone or ribeye steak</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (60ml) vegetable or canola oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons (45g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>6 sprigs thyme or rosemary (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely sliced shallots (about 1 large; optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Carefully pat steak dry with paper towels. Season liberally on all sides, including edges, with salt and pepper. If desired, let steak rest at room temperature for 45 minutes, or refrigerated, loosely covered, up to 3 days</li>
        <li>In a 12-inch heavy-bottomed cast iron skillet, heat oil over high heat until just beginning to smoke. Carefully add steak and cook, flipping frequently, until a pale golden-brown crust starts to develop, about 4 minutes total.</li>
        <li>Add butter, herbs (if using), and shallot (if using) to skillet and continue to cook, flipping steak occasionally and basting any light spots with foaming butter. If butter begins to smoke excessively or steak begins to burn, reduce heat to medium. To baste, tilt pan slightly so that butter collects by handle. Use a spoon to pick up butter and pour it over steak, aiming at light spots.</li>
        <li>Continue flipping and basting until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of tenderloin side registers 120 to 125°F (49 to 52°C) for medium-rare or 130°F (54°C) for medium, 8 to 10 minutes total.</li>
        <li>Immediately transfer steak to a large heatproof plate and pour pan juices on top. Let rest 5 to 10 minutes. Carve and serve.</li>
    </ol>
