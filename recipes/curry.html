    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>When you're craving something thick, hearty, and soul-soothing, there's 
        really nothing better than a Japanese curry. 
        Unlike Thai or Indian curries that are thickened with yogurt 
        or coconut milk, Japanese curry gets its richness from a deep, dark roux.
    </p>
    <p>If you're unfamiliar, a roux is a binder made from equal parts fat and flour. It's 
        what makes recipes like bechamel sauce or seafood gumbo SO good, and can be used 
        to improve anything from 3-cheese mac & cheese to chicken cordon bleu.
         We've got lots of extra tips for how to make roux, but our main one is: don't 
         turn your back on it, or it WILL burn. If all this sounds too intimidating
          (or you're looking for a super quick weeknight dinner), try a store-bought curry 
          bouillon instead. S&B Golden Curry makes a good one (in varying levels of spice)—if you 
          do go that route, 
        use 5 cubes of curry bouillon in place of the roux here.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breast and thighs, cut into 1”-2” pieces</li>
        <li>2 tsp. neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 large russet potato, cut into ½” cubes</li>
        <li>1 1/2 c. carrots, cut into ½” chunks</li>
        <li>1/2 c. grated apple (no need to peel)</li>
        <li>1/2 c. sliced mushrooms, such as button</li>
        <li>3 1/2 c. water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce, or store bought tonkatsu sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 c. frozen peas</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat canola oil in a 3-quart saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. 
            Brown the chicken on all sides and transfer to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the onions. Caramelize 5 to 10 minutes. 
            If the pan starts to look dry, add another tablespoon of oil.</li>  
        <li>Add the potatoes, carrots, grated apple, mushrooms and browned chicken to the caramelized onions. 
            Pour the water over it all and stir along the bottom to release any browned bits.</li>  
        <li>Add the roux. Stir to dissolve and then bring to a boil and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season to taste with the Worcestershire/Tonkatsu sauce and salt and pepper. Stir in the frozen peas and serve.</li>
    </ol>
